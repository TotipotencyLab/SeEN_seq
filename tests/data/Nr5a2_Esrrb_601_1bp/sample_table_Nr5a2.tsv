# Required columns: sample, unique_name, condition, fraction, fastq_prefix
# Note on columns:
#    Sample: sample name; this should be corresponding to the lane of the SeEN-seq gel. Thus, can be duplicated as one lane can have multiple fraction. 
#    unique_name: unique name of each row (i.e., fastq file). This will be used in the count matrix.
# DNA conc. is in the unit of ng/ul
